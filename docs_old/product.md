## 🧩 User Story — Example Flow

**Maria**, a customer, books a haircut at *Beleza Pura Salon*.  
She enters the digital queue and sees her position: “You are 3rd in line.”

When the system estimates her service will begin in 25 minutes, EasyQueue sends a notification:
> “Hi Maria, your turn is coming up soon! You’re about 10 minutes away — it’s time to start heading to the salon.”

Once Maria is within **2 km of the location**, she is allowed to perform a **check-in**, confirming her attendance.  
The salon receives a real-time update, keeping the queue accurate and smooth.

Maria arrives just in time, receives her service without waiting, and rates her experience — while the business maintains full control of flow and punctuality.
