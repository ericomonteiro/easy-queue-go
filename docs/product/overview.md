## 🧩 User Story — Example Flow

**Maria**, a customer, schedules a haircut at *Beleza Pura Salon*.  
She joins the digital queue and sees her position: "You are 3rd in line."

When the system estimates her service will start in 25 minutes, EasyQueue sends a **WhatsApp notification**:
> "Hi Maria, your turn is coming! You are about 10 minutes away — it's time to start heading to the salon."

Once Maria is **2 km from the location**, she can perform a **check-in**, confirming her presence.  
The salon receives a **real-time WhatsApp alert**, keeping the queue accurate and flowing.

Maria arrives at the right time, receives her service without waiting, and rates her experience — while the business maintains full control of flow and punctuality through automated WhatsApp communications.
